# Neural Networks for Health Technology Application
My home assignments and achievements on the course Neural Networks for Health Technology Applications. There are a few models developed for each cases to test to identify the best method to get the best accuracy. The models include:

1. Case 1: Binary Classification using Simple Neural Network
2. Case 2: Image Processing using Convolutional Neural Netwrok
3. Case 3: NLP 

Details were documented in each models of different cases which can be viewed in each file.
